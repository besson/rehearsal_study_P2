FraSCAti Standalone Distribution
--------------------------------

FraSCAti is an open source implementation of the Service Component Architecture
(SCA) specifications defined by the Open SOA consortium (OSOA).

1. Introduction
---------------

FraSCAti is a component framework providing runtime support for SCA composites
which are conform to the OSOA SCA Assembly Model 1.0 specification.

FraSCAti supports following Interface Definition Languages:
* Java interfaces
* UPnP descriptors
* WSDL port types

FraSCAti supports following implementation languages:
* BPEL
* Java POJO and SCA annotated
* FScript
* Fractal ADL
* OSGi bundles
* SCA composites
* Scala
* Scripting languages
* Spring Framework
* Xquery

FraSCAti supports following binding protocols:
* HTTP Servlet
* Java RMI
* JMS
* JSON-RPC
* REST
* SCA bindings
* SOAP Web Services
* UPnP

FraSCAti can be run as a:
* Standalone application
* Maven plugin
* WAR deployed into a Web Application Server

Advanced FraSCAti features are:
* a reflective SCA component model allowing introspection and reconfiguration
  of SCA composites at runtime
* a Java API to introspect and reconfigure SCA composites at runtime
* FraSCAti Explorer, a graphical user interface to introspect and reconfigure
  SCA composites at runtime
* FraSCAti FScript, a scripting language dedicated to the introspection and
  reconfiguration of SCA composites at runtime
* FraSCAti JMX, introspection and reconfiguration SCA composites from
  any JMX client
* FraSCAti Remote Management, introspection and reconfiguration via REST
* a configurable and extensible SCA runtime implementation
* most of FraSCAti features are implemented as SCA components


2. Requirements
---------------

Java SE 1.5 (or later) is required to compile and run SCA composites with FraSCAti.


3. Installation
---------------

Unzip the FraSCAti distribution archive and you get the following directory
structure:

  /bin      -  Launch scripts allowing to compile and run SCA composites
  /conf     -  FraSCAti configuration files
  /examples -  SCA composite and component implementation examples
  /lib      -  FraSCAti libraries
  /sca-apps -  SCA applications auto-loaded with FraSCAti Explorer

To compile and run SCA composites with FraSCAti, you have to set the 
FRASCATI_HOME variable in your system environment, where FRASCATI_HOME
is the directory where the FraSCAti runtime distribution was extracted.
Then add the FRASCATI_HOME/bin directory to the PATH.

Additionally, the FRASCATI_GENERATED variable gives the default output directory
used when FraSCAti generates Java classes. If FRASCATI_GENERATED is not given then
FraSCAti will use the current directory.


4. Building component libraries
-------------------------------

This distribution provides a build script in order to ease compilation of
SCA Java component libraries. In a command shell, from the FRASCATI_HOME
directory, type: 

  frascati compile <appDirectory> <jarName>

Where <appDirectory> is the directory containing your Java implementation
and <jarName> is the desired name for the resulting JAR file.

Each FraSCAti example provides a README file with the command to run for its
compilation.


5. Bind an SCA application to a Web Service
-------------------------------------------

The FraSCAti command provides a quick way to generate Java sources from the
WSDL file of a service.

  frascati wsdl2java [OPTIONS]

with [OPTIONS] in
    -f,--wsdl-file <arg>       the WSDL file to parse.
    -h,--help                  print this message.
    -o,--output-directory      the output directory (default:
                               target/generated/src/main/java).

6. Running SCA composites
-------------------------

SCA composites are run using the FraSCAti runtime platform. This distribution
provides a script allowing to start the FraSCAti runtime with an SCA composite.
In a command shell, from the FRASCATI_HOME directory, type:

  frascati run <composite> -libpath <jarList>
 
Where <composite> is the SCA composite file to be run by FraSCAti, designated
by its name. And <jarList> is a list of JAR files, separated by ':' under
Unix systems and ';' under Windows systems.
Note that <composite> can be a resource of the libraries loaded by FraSCAti,
a composite file in the file system, or an URL.

To run an SCA application with FraSCAti, type the following command:

  frascati run <compositeName> [OPTIONS]

with [OPTIONS] in
    -h,--help                    print this message.
    -libpath <lib.jar:path/>     a separated list of jars/paths used by FraSCAti.
    -m,--method-name <arg>       the name of the method to invoke. Can be
                                 only used if the -s option is specified.
    -p <param1 param2...>        a list of parameters for the method. Can be
                                 only used if the -m option is specified.
    -s,--service-name <arg>      the name of the service to use. If not
                                 specified, the composite is run in a (standalone)
                                 server mode.

7. FraSCAti Explorer
--------------------

To run the FraSCAti Explorer, type the following command:

  frascati explorer


8. FraSCAti FScript Console
---------------------------

To run the FraSCAti FScript Console, type the following command:

  frascati console
